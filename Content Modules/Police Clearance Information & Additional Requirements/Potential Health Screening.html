Each organization is a little different so carefully review the position description to look for this information and ask at your first meeting with your community partner supervisor. If you do not understand why you have to do something, please ask your supervisor and they will be happy to explain. It is your responsibility to complete these additional requirements as quickly as possible so you can begin your VIP placement.</span></p>
