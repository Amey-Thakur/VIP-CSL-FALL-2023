	<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: tahoma , arial , helvetica , sans-serif;">You may be asked to
			provide your immunization records for childhood vaccines and COVID-19, to be screened for TB, to get a flu
			shot, or to visit a doctor and have a health-related form completed. Each organization is a little different
			so carefully review the position description to look for this information and ask at your first meeting with
			your community partner supervisor. If you do not understand why you have to do something, please ask your
			supervisor and they will be happy to explain. It is your responsibility to complete these additional
			requirements as quickly as possible so you can begin your VIP placement.</span></p>
	<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: tahoma , arial , helvetica , sans-serif;">NOTE: A two-step TB test
			can be done here on campus and it takes 2 weeks to complete so you should start it right away if you need it
			for your placement. Click <a href="https://www.uwindsor.ca/wellness/363/tb-screening" target="_blank"
