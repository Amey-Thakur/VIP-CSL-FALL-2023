You will have ample time to use these resources in the resume module to make serious improvements to your resume before you submit it for a second review. (The first review was before you were accepted to VIP).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma , arial , helvetica , sans-serif; font-size: 12.0pt;">You are welcome to make positive changes to your resume before you see VIP roles but it's very important to also do it after you see VIP roles. This way you know what roles you are interested in and what skills or characteristics you have that the positions specifically asked for. You want to be sure to highlight those key relevant skills and provide evidence of how you gained them. More information about making skill statements is in the Resume module.&nbsp;</span></p></body></html>
